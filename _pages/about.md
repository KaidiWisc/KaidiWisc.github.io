I am a PhD student from [Civil & Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/), [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My research interest lies in satellite precipitation uncertainty quantification and associated effects in hydrologic predictions. I am also interested in hydrologic modeling uncertainty, and trying to convert the uncertainty into decision-making information. I am looking for approaches to leverage satellite products and physical/statistic models to solve real-world problems, especially in gauge-limited areas. 

I am a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology [(FINESST)](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities). I am advised by Prof. Daniel Wright of [HER Research Group](https://her.cee.wisc.edu/).
